## Status

The project is currently in the development phase and has not yet reached a point where a fully
functional concept can be presented. The minimal viable product is currently being implemented, and
it is important to note that the project is still evolving and subject to change as many aspects are
still in the process of being defined and discovered.

## Styling

#### Linting rules are defined in the `main.rs`.

#### Max line width

is restricted to 100 characters to ensure optimal readability across diverse machines

#### This project employs a two-space indentation for several reasons:

- Two spaces remain legible.
- They require less space than four spaces, thus reducing the overall file sizes.
- They do not display differently depending on the environment, in contrast to tabs.
