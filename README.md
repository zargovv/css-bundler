## Styling

#### Linting rules are defined in the `main.rs`.

#### Max line width

is restricted to 100 characters to ensure optimal readability across diverse machines

#### This project employs a two-space indentation for several reasons:

- Two spaces remain legible.
- They require less space than four spaces, thus reducing the overall file sizes.
- They do not display differently depending on the environment, in contrast to tabs.
